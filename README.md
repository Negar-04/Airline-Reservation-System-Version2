## Airline Reservation System
This project aims to simulate the online reservation system of airline tickets in a console application.

This system includes two types of users :

+ system administrator


+ passengers



  The admin user is pre-defined with a fixed username and password .(Admin)

  Passengers should create new account and then sign in.
### Admin Options :
The admin is able to add, update and remove flight details.

Also , admin can see the flight schedule.

### Passenger Options :
+ The “Booking ticket” mode is based on flight id. By booking each ticket, a unique code is generated as a ticket id.
+ The “ticket cancellation” process by each ticket id would be confirmed and the refund would be credited back to the account(charge).
+ Filter tickets based on flight id, origin, destination, date, time, price range, or some of them in “Search flight tickets” mode.
+ The “Booked tickets” mode includes all reserved tickets of the user.
+ Also , passenger can "change password"  and  "Add charge".
